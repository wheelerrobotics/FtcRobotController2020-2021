if lowest start position for arm doesnt work,
we may need to make a way to position the arm
reliably somewhere else

make sure to update driver hub software on tuesday

make sure encoders are plugged into fast ports (0,3)
make sure slides are plugged into slow ports

make sure all servos have enough reach for any position
make sure servo wires wont get stuck !!!!



NECESSARY TUNING PROCESS (for tue)

0 Set up mats - 7m

1 LocalizationTest - 5m
    Run Localization test
    Drag bot across 90+ in of field tiles 3 times for x & y and average for multiplier

2 TrackingWheelLateralDistanceTuner - 2m
    Line up bot with mat (prep for 360)
    right js1 turns bot, turn bot 10x then press Y
    change LATERAL_DISTANCE to effective lateral distance

    might want to do same with TrackingWheelForwardOffsetTuner

3 Localization Test - 2m
    make sure nothing is glaringly wrong, drive around
    go to https://learnroadrunner.com/dead-wheels.html#troubleshooting if trouble

4 ManualFeedforwardTuner - 20m
    follow https://learnroadrunner.com/feedforward-tuning.html#tuning

5 StraightTest - 5m
    bot should go 60in, run a few times
    if trouble, check https://learnroadrunner.com/straight-test.html

6 StrafeTest - 7m
    bot should go 60in
    if not, change LATERAL_MULTIPLIER in SampleMecanumDrive.java (line 57) to actual_distance/60
    rerun and it should be good

7 MaxAngularVelocityTuner - 1m
    set MAX_ANG_VEL in DriveConstants to spat out value
    might want to do same with MaxVelocityTuner

8 TrackWidthTuner - 1m // dont know if necessary for odo wheels?
    will turn 180 deg 5 times, DONT TOUCH
    use number it spits out as track width

9 TurnTest - 1m
    pop a 90
    if not 90, do 180
    dont care if 90 doesnt work, thats some pid shenanigans we fix later

10 LocalizationTest - 2m
    Checkpoint to make sure you havent broke everything
    drive around and make sure it doesnt look like the localization is screwed up

11 PID - 40m
    1 BackAndForth - 20m
        use to get coarse gains (values)
        should be adjusting: HEADING_PID and TRANSLATION_PID in SampleMecanumDrive dropdown
        HEADING_PID first:
            increse kP till keeping accurate heading (~8 for them)
            dont need kD/kI (might want a bit of kD (non-zero, 1 or smth) for keeping vel same with dif voltages)
        TRANSLATION_PID next:
            increse kP till keeping accurate heading (~8 for them)
            dont need kD/kI (might want a bit of kD (non-zero, 1 or smth) for keeping vel same with dif voltages)
        TAKE VALUES AND COPY INTO SAMPLE MECCANUM DRIVE!!! SAVE THE PID VALUES!!!
        TAKE VALUES AND COPY INTO SAMPLE MECCANUM DRIVE!!! SAVE THE PID VALUES!!!


    1 FollowerPIDTuner - 20m
        use to get finer gains (values)
            Repeat baf

12 SplineTest - 2m
    run spline test and watch as everything definitely runs perfect :)))
    if some oscillations, p is too high somewhere

13 Celebrate!

14 despair :( when my TurnAround & NoTurnAround opmodes dont 5-cycle immediately
