    1 Scan signal
    2 Grab preload
        1 close claw

        2 rotate arm to pickup (level)
        2 rotate wrist to pickup (level)
        3 drop slides to corresponding cone height
    1 Drive spline from junction to stack
    2 Grab cone from stack
        1 close claw
        2 move slides up (not all the way)
    3 Drive spline to junction from stack
    3 cone to appropriate position
        1 move slides to high height
        1 arm over to not all the way level in place side (slant for easier placing)
        2 wrist to not all the way level (slant for easier placing)
    4 place cone
